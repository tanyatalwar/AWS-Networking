AWS is divided into regions
AWS -> Regions -> Azs
VPC is logically isolated network
VPC can be divided into subnet of different size
each VPC is present within a region
User defined IP Range
Can contain both private and public subnet
VPC Components
- Subnet (Private/Public)
- that is they can contain private or public resources

- You can manipulate how traffic flows into or out of subnet through Route tables

- If you use access to internet  within a VPC you can use internet gateway

- If you want to IPV6 prohibit inbound connections you can use Engress-only internet gateway

- If you want to access private network within AWS services you can use VPC Endpoint 

- If you want to enable private access to other AWS Accounts without transversing the internet VPC Endpoint is used

- to let private resources access internet you need NAT Gateways(NAT stands for Network address translation)

- For Application expose to internet and Database to be private
- you need 2 subnet private and public
- internet gateway/router
- Route table for each of the subnet
- let say you are storing some data in S3 you can setup a VPC endpoint
